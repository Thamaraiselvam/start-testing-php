# Start Testing Your PHP Code

This is the sample project used during my *Start Testing Your PHP Code* workshop given at PHP[world], Lonestar PHP, Zencon, and other conferences.

Attendees should clone this repository and run `composer install` prior to the workshop to ensure they have all the necessary tools installed and avoid the inevitable issues with *conference WiFi*.
